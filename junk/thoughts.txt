I am assuming that sales are finilized onced entered.
Meaning that the data entered will stay as is under all circumstances.
Because of this I figure that it is unnesisary to use pointers, in anyway,
and if for some reason we need the item, we have the ID to look it up.

As well, this means sales cannot be deleted, however it may be something to consider implimenting.

Also assuming diffrent sales files can be loaded, but there will only be one 
Items file per system.

Also assuming all the data on the csv file is correct

figure distinguishing making a new sales sheet vs loading up one is worth it
