# Contributing Guidelines

## Style Guide
Ideally, this will be a fairly short guide with just a few things we should all agree on for consistency purposes.

1. Spaces over tabs -- set your editor to do 2 spaces when you tab.
1. Functions should be PascalCased.
1. Variables should be snake_cased.
1. Constants should be UPPER_SNAKE_CASED.
1. Function parameters should be constant when possible.
1. Function paremeters should be references when possible.
1. No using namespace std; use the std:: prefix to access members.
1. Favor the 'auto' keyword for long type names, such as iterators.
1. Curly braces should go on a newline.
1. Comments should not be redundant, but you should comment things that are unclear.
